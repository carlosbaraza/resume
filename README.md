# EXPERIENCE

## Senior Software Engineer (Head of development)
### Hire Space, London, 04/2016 to present
HireSpace.com is the UK's leading venue marketplace. Our business model
is similar to Airbnb, with the difference that we advertise venues,
instead of apartments.
* Lead Engineer and line manager in an Agile team of 5 engineers,
  closely working with two product managers and one QA Specialist.
* 300+ commits in a back office application used to manage
  our bookings and our customer base. The web application is built
  using Meteor (Node), Blaze and React.
* Developed the referral, rewards and promo schemas; and
  integrated them with all our systems. These features
  brought more than 150 enquiries.
* Developed multiple features for hirespace.com, and
  venues.hirespace.com (admin section for venue managers).
  Both built using ASP.NET and Angular.JS.
* As a full stack engineer I have done a lot of dev ops: set up
  automated builds for multiple projects in Team City, migrated
  entire production to a more stable provider, set up new deployment scripts,
  configured DNSs, configured servers, configured cron jobs,
  improved email deliverability migrating to Amazon SES (between other changes).
* Developed a venue proposal application using React + Meteor. A salesman
  would select venues from our data base and prepare an interactive
  proposal for the customer. The customer would interact with sales
  through the proposal application, providing feedback until
  finally she books a venues with us.
* Contributed to creating a very united team of engineers. We have all
  become good friends, meeting out of office hours for events, meetups,
  dinner, arcades, etc.
* Improved the engineering process: reconfigured Jira for an improved
  workflow and better reports, facilitated systematic standups, grooming
  sessions, planning, retrospectives and realistic sprints. These
  changes boosted team performance and most importantly, team happiness;
  because at the end of the sprints, we felt that we had accomplished
  the goals we had for the sprint.
